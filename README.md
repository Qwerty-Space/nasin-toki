# nasin toki ponaâ€”a good way to speak
*by jan Juli (kili pan Juli / cile pa n-Ile)*

In this document I aim to provide a comprehensive grammar of toki pona.
Since toki pona is a very personal language, this will reflect my own opinions and style decisions.
That said, nothing about this `nasin toki` is unusual.
If you follow this grammar, you will be well understood by most (if not all) toki pona speakers.

# basics

## how to read this grammar
- Throughout this document, I will use
  - single capital letters (e.g. `X`) to represent any valid toki pona [*content word*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#content-words) or [*compound*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#compounds)
  - `<prep>` to refer to any of the [*prepositions*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#prepositions)
  - `<preverb>` to refer to any of the [*preverbs*](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs)
- Code-blocks of text contain valid toki pona sentences (when replacing the above-mentioned abbreviations with real words).
Brackets mark the bracketed part as optional, e.g. `toki [ni] li pona`
- All translations are mere suggestions.
Since toki pona is highly **context-sensitive**, there is never only a single valid interpretation of a given sentence.


## general principles
- implied politeness
- no recursion
- conjunction by repeating the appropriate particle


## word types
This sections lists the types of words in toki pona.
Some people might analyze certain things differently.
Importantly, when these word types are mentioned in this document, the corresponding words listed here are what is referred to.

### particles
`en`, `li`, `e`, `la`, `pi`, `o`, `a`

*Particles* are words that have no semantic meaning on their own.
They are purely grammatical words that exist to mark parts of speech, context, modifier-order, and emotional emphasis.

#### pseudo-particles
`taso`, `anu`

The *pseudo-particles* are mostly used as conjunctions (meaning "but" and "or", respectively).
Rare usage: Sometimes, they also act as content words with semantic fields around the concepts of "alone" and "choice", respectively.

### content words
Literally every other word in toki pona is a *content word* with semantic meaning attached.
Every content word can work like all of what is called "adjective", "adverb", "verb", "noun" in English.
Some of these are part of special groupings that give them additional grammatical functions.
All the words that aren't mentioned in this section are pure content words.

#### pronouns
`mi`, `sina`, `ona`, `ni`

The *pronouns*, like all content words in toki pona, are *both* singular and plural (quite like the English "you").

#### prepositions
`lon`, `tawa`, `tan`, `sama`, `kepeken`

*Prepositions* are used to further describe the manner of the predicate.
They indicate information about where, whither, whence, how, or whereby the predicate is performed.

#### preverbs
(pu) `wile`, `sona`, `awen`, `kama`, `ken`, `lukin`  
(popular usage) `open`, `pini`, `alasa`

The *preverbs* are special words that can change the meaning of the predicate in ways normal modifiers cannot.
Unlike all other modification in toki pona, they occur *before* the predicate they are applied to.

## sentence structure
A basic toki pona sentence looks like this:

`X li Y [e Z]`[^li-dropping]

(more [complex sentence structures (TODO)](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#complex-sentence-structure) are of course possible)

[^li-dropping]: Whenever our main character, the subject `X` is exactly the word `mi` (and nothing else) or exactly the word `sina` (and nothing else), the particle `li` is dropped from the sentence.
  Examples:
  *only* `mi`: `mi lukin e ona` ("I see them.");
  *not only* `mi`: `tomo mi li lili` ("My house is small.")
  
Example: `soweli li moku e kili` ("An animal eats fruit.")

#### the subject
- `X` is the main character of our sentence, the **subject**
  - It can be a person, a thing, an idea, anything really
  - The important part is that our sentence describes what `X` is or is doing
#### the predicate
- `Y` is this thing they are or are doing, the **predicate**
  - It can be an action; like working, playing, talking
  - ... a description; like blue, good, tall
  - ... or a thing; like house, animal, food
#### the object
- `Z` is the thing that the action is done to, the **direct object**
  - it can also be basically anything
  - it is either the reciever of the action `Y` performed by `X`, e.g `soweli li pali e tomo` ~ "The animal builds a nest."
  - ... or the stimulus that `X` experiences through doing `Y`, e.g. `soweli li lukin e kili` ~ "The animal sees a fruit."


## questions
There are three different ways to build a question.

### `X ala X`
This construction is used for simple yes-or-no questions: `Y li X ala X`
It asks the listener whether the sentence `Y li X` is true.  
To answer an `X ala X` question, simply repeat the predicate for yes (`X`) or the predicate followed by `ala` for "no" (`X ala`).
Of course it is always possible to answer in a full sentence instead.

Example:  
`soweli loje li moku ala moku e kili` ("Do foxes eat vegetables?")  
`moku ala` ("No.")

If the predicate is a [compound](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#compounds), you may just repeat the head, e.g. `jan li pana ala pana pi wawa mute e sike` ("Does the person yeet the ball?").

### `anu seme`
The second way to ask a yes-or-no question is `X li Y anu seme`.
This is not much different from the first, but it suggests a less simple answer than just "yes" or "no" may be expected.
It is answered the same way as the `X ala X` question.

Example:  
`lete li lon ma sina anu seme` ("Is it cold where you are?")  
`lete. taso suno pini li seli a` ("Yes, but yesterday it was very warm!")

### `seme`
If we replace the thing that is asked for with `seme`, we can ask an open question.
Using this construction, we ask the listener to fill the place of `seme` with the appropriate information.
These types of question are best answered with a full sentence.

Examples:
`jan seme li toki` ("Who is speaking?")  
`mi toki.` ("I am.")

`ona li seme` ("What did they do?")  
`ona li tawa tomo ona` ("They walked home.")

`sina lukin e seme` ("What are you watching?")  
`mi lukin e waso` ("I am watching birds.")


## compounds
Since toki pona has a very minimalist lexicon, all the content words cover broad semantic fields.
To specify what we are talking about, we can build *compounds*.  
A compound consists of a main content word, the **head**, and at least one additional content word, the **modifier(s)**.
Since toki pona is *head-initial*, the first word in a compound is the head, all following ones are modifiers.

The head is the main thing we are talking about, while the modifiers further specify the head's (usually very broad) semantic field.
We can always remove any modifiers from a given phrase without changing that it *could* refer to the same thing as before, but it becomes less specific by doing so.

Example: In `tomo waso` ("bird-house"), the word `tomo` is the head while `waso` modifies it.
We are talking first and foremost about a `tomo`.
The modifier tells us that the `tomo` is in some way related to the semantic field of `waso`.

### multiple modifiers
If multiple modifiers are present they all apply to the head of the phrase.
We can simply append modifiers like `X Y Z` is an `X` that is related to `Y` and to `Z`
The order in which modifiers is not strictly important, but it can be used to highlight the earlier modifiers.

Examples:  
`soweli suli pimeja` ("dark big animal")
`jan lawa pona` ("good leader")

### the particle `pi`
To modify the head with another compounded expression instead of a single content word, we precede that expression with `pi`.

Example:  
`poki pi telo wawa` ("strong-liquid container", e.g. a cup of coffee), but  
`poki telo wawa` ("strong liquid-container", e.g. a diamond bottle)


## how to use prepositions
[Prepositions](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#prepositions) are generally used to mark different kinds of indirect objects.
They can be used in two ways.
They are either appended to the predicate they modify or come directly after `li` in predicate-less sentences.  
- `X li Y <prep> Z`
- `X li <prep> Y`

Example:  
`kasi li suli tan wawa suno` ("The plants are big because of the sun's power.")  
`ona li kepeken ilo` ("They use tools."; literally: "They, using tools."; Note that while this kind of construction is not valid in English, it is so in other languages such as Russian and toki pona.)


## how to use preverbs
The [preverbs](https://github.com/kilipan/nasin-toki#preverbs) are used to change the semantic field in ways that simple modifiers cannot.
They are simple added *in front of* the predicate they are applied to.

`X li <preverb> Y [e Z]`

Note that the direct object (here `Z`) relates to the predicate (here `Y`) and *not* to the preverb.


## how to say "and"
The word "and" has no translation in toki pona.
Instead, a general rule is to just repeat the appropriate particle to form conjunctions.

#### multiple subjects
To combine different words into a subject, we use the word `en`.

`X en Y li Z`  
`A en B en C li D`

#### multiple predicates
To say that a subject `X` is doing two things, `Y` and `Z` we just repeat the predicate marker `li` like so:

`X li Y li Z`

If the subject is `mi` or `sina`, we just leave out the first `li` as usual, but still use it for any following predicates.[^pu-note-mi-sina]

[^pu-note-mi-sina]: In *pu*, this is disallowed.
  Instead, it suggests starting a new sentence for each predicate: `mi X. mi Y. mi Z.`

`mi X li Y li Z`

#### multiple direct objects
To add multiple objects, just repeat the particle `e`.

`A li B e C e D`

#### multiple prepositional phrases
We can also add multiple prepositional phrases to a sentence.
- `A li B <prep> C <prep> D`
- `A li <prep> B <prep> C`

#### combining different conjunctions
When multiple predicates are present, it can be ambiguous which predicate(s) the object(s) and preposition(s) apply to.

Example: `jan li pali li pakala e tomo e kasi lon ma kepeken luka`  
(Note how this ambiguity is also present in English:
"The person makes and breaks a house and plants in the field by means of their hands.")

We can sometimes resolve the ambiguity by restructuring:
`jan li pali e tomo lon ma li pakala e kasi kepeken luka`
