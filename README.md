# nasin toki pona—a good way to speak
*by jan Juli (kili pan Juli / cile pa n-Ile)*

In this document I aim to provide a comprehensive grammar of toki pona.
Since toki pona is a very personal language, this will reflect my own opinions and style decisions.
That said, if you keep to this `nasin toki`, you will be well understood by most toki pona speakers.

## how to read

- Throughout this document, I will use variables (e.g. `X`, `Y`, `Z`).
These represent any valid toki pona *content word* (cf. section TODO).
- Code-blocks of text contain valid toki pona sentences.
Brackets mark the bracketed part as optional, e.g. `[toki] ni li pona`
- All translations are mere suggestions.
Since toki pona is highly **context-sensitive**, there is never only a single valid interpretation of a given sentence.

## types of words

## basic sentence structure

A basic toki pona sentence looks like this:

`X li Y [e Z]`

- `X` is the main character of our sentence, the **subject**
  - It can be a person, a thing, an idea—anything really
  - The important part is that our sentence describes what `X` is or is doing
- `Y` is this thing they are or are doing, the **predicate**
  - It can be an action—like working, playing, talking
  - ... a description—like blue, good, tall
  - ... or a thing—like house, animal, food
- `Z` is the thing that the action is done to, the **direct object**
  - it can also be basically anything
  - it is either the reciever of the action `Y` performed by `X`, e.g `soweli li pali e tomo` ~ "The animal builds a nest."
  - ... or the stimulus that `X` experiences through doing `Y`, e.g. `soweli li lukin e kili` ~ "The animal sees a fruit."

Whenever our main character, the subject `X` is exactly the word `mi` (and nothing else) or exactly the word `sina` (and nothing else), the particle `li` is dropped from the sentence.
