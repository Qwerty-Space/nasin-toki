# nasin toki pona—a good way to speak
*by jan Juli (kili pan Juli / cile pa n-Ile)*

In this document I aim to provide a comprehensive grammar of toki pona.
Since toki pona is a very personal language, this will reflect my own opinions and style decisions.
That said, if you keep to this `nasin toki`, you will be well understood by most toki pona speakers.

## how to read
- Throughout this document, I will use variables (e.g. `X`, `Y`, `Z`).
These represent any valid toki pona *content word* (cf. section TODO).
- Code-blocks of text contain valid toki pona sentences.
Brackets mark the bracketed part as optional, e.g. `[toki] ni li pona`
- All translations are mere suggestions.
Since toki pona is highly **context-sensitive**, there is never only a single valid interpretation of a given sentence.

## general principles
- no recursion
- conjunction by repeating the appropriate particle

## word types

### particles
Particles are words that have no semantic meaning on their own.
They are purely grammatical words that exist to mark parts of speech, modifier-order, and emotional emphasis.
The particles are
`en`, `li`, `e`, `la`, `pi`, `o`, `a`.

### content words
Literally every other word in toki pona is a content word with semantic meaning attached.
Some of these are part of special groupings that give them additional grammatical functions.
All the words that aren't mentioned in this section are pure content words.

#### pronouns
The pronouns are `mi` (1st person), `sina` (2nd person), `ona` (3rd person), and `ni` (demonstrative).
As all content words in toki pona, they are *both* singular and plural (quite like the English "you").

#### pseudo-particles
The words `taso` and `anu` are mostly used as conjunction particles (meaning "but" and "or", respectively).
They can also act as content words with semantic fields around the concepts of "alone" and "choice", respectively.

#### prepositions
Prepositions further describe the predicate.
They carry information about where, whither, whence, how, or whereby the predicate is performed.
Thy are `lon`, `tawa`, `tan`, `sama`, `kepeken`.

#### preverbs
The preverbs are special words that modify the meaning of the predicate.
Unlike all other modification in toki pona, they occur *before* the predicate they are modifying.
The preverbs are
(pu) `wile`, `sona`, `awen`, `kama`, `ken`, `lukin`, and (additionally, by popular usage)
`open`, `pini`, `alasa`.


## sentence structure
A *basic* toki pona sentence looks like this:

`X li Y [e Z]`[^li-dropping]

[^li-dropping]: Whenever our main character, the subject `X` is exactly the word `mi` (and nothing else) or exactly the word `sina` (and nothing else), the particle `li` is dropped from the sentence.
  Examples:
  *only* `mi`: `mi lukin e ona` ("I see them.");
  *not only* `mi`: `tomo mi li lili` ("My house is small.")

#### the subject
- `X` is the main character of our sentence, the **subject**
  - It can be a person, a thing, an idea—anything really
  - The important part is that our sentence describes what `X` is or is doing
#### the predicate
- `Y` is this thing they are or are doing, the **predicate**
  - It can be an action—like working, playing, talking
  - ... a description—like blue, good, tall
  - ... or a thing—like house, animal, food
#### the object
- `Z` is the thing that the action is done to, the **direct object**
  - it can also be basically anything
  - it is either the reciever of the action `Y` performed by `X`, e.g `soweli li pali e tomo` ~ "The animal builds a nest."
  - ... or the stimulus that `X` experiences through doing `Y`, e.g. `soweli li lukin e kili` ~ "The animal sees a fruit."

## compound phrases

#### en-phrase

#### li-phrase

#### pi-phrase

#### prepositional phrase
